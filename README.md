# add_data_node_js
We are going to develop node js API which can be used to Add data in database just as a form from a server side
<br>
This is sample API in which we are passing only three parameters name, email and phone.
<br>
In case of using it in different places with different parameters, everything is ready, we just have to change schema of database.
<br>
This is simple API, no validation are used to verify inputs
<br>
